## üîê Setup GDSync Keys

You need a `gd_sync_secrets.cfg` file in the root:

private_key="your_private_key"
```

You can get these keys by signing up at [gd-sync](https://www.gd-sync.com/)

## üß† Dev Notes

- `ChatRoom.gd` handles multiplayer logic, spawning players, syncing chat & positions
- `player.gd` handles local movement + animation, and calls `update_animation()` on ChatRoom for remote updates
- Uses `GDSync.call_func(...)` to sync peer state
- Syncing is minimal: just position + animations ‚Äî physics is client-authoritative
